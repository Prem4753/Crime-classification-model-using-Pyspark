# Crime-classification-model-using-Pyspark
•	Utilized a dataset from Kaggle on San Francisco Crime. Created a system that could automatically assign a described crime to category which could help law enforcements to assign right officers to crime. 

•	The proposed approach was executed using a variety of feature extraction techniques, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, blended logistic regression and Naive Bayes with count vectorizer individually, supervised machine learning algorithms in pyspark. 

•	Achieved a notable accuracy of 97.2% by applying logistic regression using Count vectorizer and 99.3% using Naive Bayes with count vectorizer.

•	Highlighted the superiority of Count vectoriser for this dataset and the effectiveness of Naive Bayes for text analysis over logistic regression.
